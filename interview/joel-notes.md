# Joel notes

-   an introduction to designing functions in C that consume arrays,
    suitable for students taking an introductory course in software
    design.
-   You may assume that students have already been exposed to the
    concepts of variables, data types, mutation, branching, looping,
    arrays and functions that consume/produce primitive data (such as
    int or double).
-   You should begin your sample lecture by explaining any additional
    context in which you assume it is placed, for example, other topics
    that you assume were covered earlier in the course.
    -   Imagine we are around lecture 6-7 or so, I called it seven just
        to have something.
    -   Students have covered pointers and size of arrays, as well as
        being familiar with the environment we use for writing and
        running code.
    -   Familiar with polling software, lecture notes, good font size
        etc. I will just use slido here, track student participation in
        live question and give grades
        -   For a real class I would use a polling software that tracks
            participation but not student’s answers so that they could
            be graded for participating since this active thinking is
            good for learning. Here I just use something so that you can
            see the questions and respond if you want to.
    -   Generally I will say things like “as you remember” or similar
        when I assume we have covered something in class.
-   The second portion of the interview will be a broader discussion of
    your teaching approach and past experience, strategies for
    encouraging active learning.
    -   Cool introductory examples with tangible products, like cool
        visualizations
    -   Engaging topics that we care about so that student can get
        interested
    -   Many poll questions
    -   Give a few minutes to code out the solution to a problem.
        -   Didn’t do here…
    -   Talk to neighbor, pairing up so that there is peer instruction
    -   Flipped classrooms and Worksheets
    -   Live coding great to show errors nad how to fix
    -   Hand drawn diagram videos whenever appropriate, similar to Khan
        academy
        -   Also anumations
    -   Project based team-work.
    -   Being relatable as a teacher imposter syndrom
-   Some role-playing scenarios involving student and/or TA
    interactions.
-   what courses in our curriculum you would feel confident to teach,
-   and any questions you might have about the position.
    -   Size
    -   Still flipped classroom?
        -   What would be my role exactly? Help students with worksheets
            more than lecturing?
    -   Exact dates, mike mentioned that ECE take over in the end?
